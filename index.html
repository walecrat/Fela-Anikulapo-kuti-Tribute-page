        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Nigerian singer, musician and songwriter, Fela Anikulapo Kuti pioneer of afrojuju 
        genre(combination of funk, jazz, and Yoruba chants) is arguably the most iconic 
        legends of all time in Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p>Influenced by the politics of the ‘Black Panther Party, Fela immediately became 
          prolific civil right activist in Nigeria giving his music voice in exposing and opposing 
          injustice, corruption and bad governance. 
        </p>
      
        <h2>Early life in Nigeria</h2> 
        <p>Born on october 15, 1938, in abeokuta, Nigeria to a feminist and labour activist 
          Funmilayo Ransome-kuti. After completing high school in Abeokuta, Kuti was briefly 
          employed as a clerk at the ‘Federal Ministry of Commerce’ before being sent to London 
          to study medicine. 
        </p>
        <p>Arriving at the Trinity college London in the late 1950's, he decided to switch to 
          music, enrolling at the Trinity College of Music. He formed his first band called 
          Koola Lobitos which he played in college in London. After moving back to Nigeria in
          1963, he re-formed the band, trained as a radio producer, and worked with trumpeter 
          Victor Olaiya.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Afrika 70</h2>
        <p>In 1969, Kuti and his associates embarked on a 10-month trip of the US, where he met
          Sandra Izsadore, a ‘Black Panther’ activist who introduced him to the politics of 
          Malcolm X and other ‘Black Power’ advocates. Kuti was fascinated, and later credited 
          this experience as the catalyst for much of his activism. During this period, he also 
          renamed his band ‘Nigeria ‘70.’ After running into trouble with the US immigration 
          authorities, Kuti returned to Nigeria, where he again changed the band name 
          to ‘Afrika ‘70.’. 
        </p>
        <p>After this trip, the band began to focus more on socio-political issues, instead of 
          exclusively romantic concerns. In 1974, Kuti built a fence around his house and 
          created a sovereign commune, the ‘Kalakuta Republic.’ This location housed a 
          recording studio.
        </p>

        <h2>Politics and assination attempts</h2>
        <p>In 1979 Fela formed a political party, the Movement of the People, and ran 
          unsuccessfully for the presidency of Nigeria. Five years later he was jailed for 20 
          months on charges of currency smuggling. Upon his release, he turned away from active 
          political protest and left his son, Femi, to carry the torch of Afro-beat music. Fela 
          was jailed again in 1993 for murder, but the charges were eventually dropped.
        </p>
        <p>In 1977, he, along with and ‘Afrika ‘70,’ released ‘Zombie,’ a politically charged 
          piece that decried the methods of the Nigerian military. Although exceedingly popular 
          with the public, this album invited swift and terrible backlash from the government, 
          which sent 1000 soldiers to attack the ‘Kalakuta Republic,’ destroyed his property, 
          injured Kuti, and threw his elderly mother from a window.  His mother later succumbed 
          to her injuries and him exiled to Ghana. On August 3, 1997, He died as a result of 
          complications from <abbr title="acquired immunodeficiency syndrome" style="color:blue;">AIDS</abbr>.
